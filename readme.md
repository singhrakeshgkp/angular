# Standalone Componet
- In the past we were using non-standalone component, we we want to use any component that component must be defined in app.module.ts file under @NgModule declaration section as shown below.
  ```
   @NgModule({
    declarations: [
    user,
    student
  ]
  })
  ``` 
- Create new component --> ```ng g c <component name> or ng generate component <component name>```
